# This is V42
Rules for using:  
1. Only M5s may push to __master__  
2. Other branches can be used by admins  
3. master is sometimes uncompilable  
4. Has to be compiled, __no compiled version here__  
5. Some commits will crash, this is sometimes intended  
6. If uncompilable or crashing, use an older version  
7. Try keeping the size of the compiled version rather small  
8. (evtl.) All take smite and go to __botlane__  
9. Read the __Controls__ before using (May be outdated though)  
A. The contents of "Beschreibung" are probably useless  
B. Small changes in the text files can (and will) produce a crash  
C. When something is needed public, __make public!__  
D. __Avoid__ getters and setters  
E. The other character is for testing bugged hair which heavily bugs on the player character  
F. V42 has a very problematic dependancy matrix, fix pls
