# This is V42
Rules for using:  
1. Only M5s may push to __master__  
2. Other branches can be used by admins  
3. Admins only, no access restrictions (currently)  
4. master is sometimes uncompilable  
5. Has to be compiled, __no compiled version here__  
6. Some commits will crash, this is sometimes intended  
7. If uncompilable or crashing, use an older version  
8. Try keeping the size of the compiled version rather small  
9. (evtl.) All take smite and go botlane  
A. Read the __Controls__ before using  
B. The contents of "Beschreibung" are outdated, do not use  
C. Small changes in the text files can (and will) produce a crash  
D. When something is needed public, __make public!__  
E. Try __avoiding__ getters and setters  
F. The copy of the player character is for testing visual things
