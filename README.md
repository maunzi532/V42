# This is V42
Rules for using:  
1. Only M5s may push to master  
2. Other branches can be used by admins  
3. Admins only, no access restrictions (currently)  
4. master is sometimes uncompilable  
5. Has to be compiled, no compiled version here  
6. Some commits will crash, this is sometimes intended  
7. If uncompilable or crashing, use an older version  
8. Try keeping the size of the compiled version rather small  
9. (evtl.) All take smite and go botlane  
A. Read the Controls before using  
B. The contents of "Beschreibung" are outdated, do not use  
C. Small changes in the text files can (and will) produce a crash  
D. When something is needed public, make public  
E. Try avoiding getters and setters  
F. The copy of the player character is for testing visual things
