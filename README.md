# This is V42
Rules for using:  
3. this is sometimes uncompilable  
4. Has to be compiled, __no compiled version here__  
5. Some commits will crash, this is sometimes intended  
6. If uncompilable or crashing, try using an older version  
7. Try keeping the size of the compiled version rather small  
8. (evtl.) All take smite and go to __botlane__  
9. Read the __Controls__ before using (May be outdated though)  
A. Any changes in the text files can (and will) produce a crash  
B. Not in the Editor  
C. When something is needed public, __make public!__  
D. __Avoid__ getters and setters (especially setters)  
E. The other character is for testing bugged hair which heavily bugs on the player character  
F. The Editor has no manual

# Controls (Probably will not work)
The Controls depend on your Overlay Settings  
Go to Einstellungen/Overlay1 and replace TA1  
with TA2 if you want the second control scheme (This is because of weird programming and should get fixed)  
I,W - forward, grab edge, climb up  
J,A - left  
L,D - right  
K,S - backward  
U,Q - jump, get up  
O,E - crouch, fall faster  
Z,Y - __red__ direction  
P,X - __green__ direction  
0,3 - place flag  
;,> - (hold) show some __settings__  
6,5 - switch to the __flying camera__  
Left Mouse - shoot the left thing forward  
- flying - increase the number of the faced block  
Right Mouse - shoot the right thing forward  
- flying - set the number of the faced block to 0  
  
These only work if you use the TastenDrehInput  
T,↑ - Turn upwards  
F,← - Turn left  
H,→ - Turn right  
G,↓ - Turn downwards
